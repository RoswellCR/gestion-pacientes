# ReactJS-Form-without-consuming-API
This repository contains simple React-Form which takes data (First name, Last Name, User Name, Email &amp; Password) as input render it to the browser without consuming any API i-e not connected with backend but using onChange function I made it a bit dynamic showing data on browser in real-time.
